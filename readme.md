## Getting Started

I pulled down this falcor, built it and ran one of the samples to make sure it worked ok: "SimpleDeferred"
https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Falcor/commit/0b561caae19e8325853166cc4c93d4763570774a

I followed the instructions for "creating a new project" in the readme.md file
* If you haven't done so already, create a Visual Studio solution and project for your code. Falcor only supports 64-bit builds, so make sure you have a 64-bit build configuration
* Add Falcor.props to your project (Property Manager -> Right click your project -> Add existing property sheet)
* Add Falcor.vcxproj to your solution
* Add a reference to Falcor in your project (Solution Explorer -> Your Project -> Right Click References -> Click Add Reference... -> Choose Falcor)

I coppied the "ComputeShader" project's files into my own project...
* ComputeShader.cpp / .h
* Data/compute.hlsl

Compiled and rand and it worked woo.  Now time to start writing code.

## Pathtracing

Starting simple with just diffuse and emissive, I used the info from my previous post:
https://blog.demofox.org/2016/09/21/path-tracing-getting-started-with-diffuse-and-emissive/

But also:
* importance sampling via cosine weighted hemisphere sampling (explain)
* jittering the camera





## TODOs

* try using blue noise in cosine weighted hemispheres?
* add temporal AA?
* have imgui options for these.

Next: specular!  Make a short blog post about this and a tag / release to link to from the blog post?



? rename "ComputeShader" class / file to path tracer
